# Seppuku

# Exploring The Unknown

Originality at its core means one thing, that is "created directly and personally by a particular artist; not a copy or imitation." Being presented with this task can be difficult as there are already so many original things out there, it is very tough to think of something of your own to add to that pile. Tackling this challenge alone can be an issue, but when you work together, anything can be possible, even when it looks like it would all go wrong. 

Facing this obstacle together, my group and I created a feudal Japanese inspired puzzle platformer based on the deaths of Samurai, abtly named Seppuku.

This group consisted of the following members...

Kristijan Zvonarek (Producer and Programmer)

Yuri Jia (Programmer)

Adeline Zhang (Artist)

Davis Germain (Sound Designer)

# The Pitch

It was not decided at the start that Seppuku would be created. My group and I were given the task to come up with three game ideas, all for different platforms including mobile devices, a "Jam-O-Drum", and "The Cave". Whether one of these ideas would be chosen was completely up to the TAs and Professors. To my understanding a game was chosen based on creativity, possible functionality, and how it compared to other groups as there was a limit to how many could work with either one of the platforms.

Game idea one was what became Seppuku, game number two was a team based cooking simulator, and game number three was a move in day time based balancing simulator where you had to avoid having a house tilting off the side of the mountain.

Game number two and three were both designed to take use off the two special platforms, the Jam-O-Drum and The Cave respectively. At the end of the day, Seppuku, for mobile, was designated to my group and I. Showcased here, are some of the pitch slides created to showcase what we brainstormed in a more condensed manner.

# Seppuku Pitch Concept Ideas

**For the final product many ideas were scaled down for time management and an overall more focused experience for the player**

# Initial Challenges

Starting from complete scratch can be difficult, doing it by yourself even more so. Having a group with experience under their belts, and a group of passionate people with a similar goal, to create a good game, was reassuring. With high aspirations and high moral, we began work right away after it was decided we would work on Seppuku. What that meant for me, now that I was a programmer, and continued to be a producer, was to begin balancing my roles. I worked first on getting the group organized with a task sheet, daily goals, planned meetings, and a place to share files. The only thing I regret, is not pushing the game design document more. It was worked on for a while, but then dropped pretty quickly, leading to a bit more of a vague idea of what the final product would be. We had many ideas, some more thought out than others, and in the end a lot had to be cut. 

On the programming side, now having done a week of audio, I had to get right back to utilizing Unity. I stressed out a bit as I kept thinking about any thing that I may have forgot, but when I began to code, everything came back immediately. The biggest challenge on this front was the collaboration method of Seppuku, as we struggled on getting Unity Plastic to work, the built in Unity file sharing system. So, we had to switch to a more unfamilar, and at times aggravating platform, Perfoce, which would throughout the game development process cause many issues. There was a small, but tedious learning curve that caused some small hiccups, but we managed to overcome it and become very efficient within it.

# Prototyping

Seppuku had many changes along the way as of mid October of 2022.
