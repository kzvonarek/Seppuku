# Seppuku - Exploring The Unknown

Originality at its core means one thing, that is "created directly and personally by a particular artist; not a copy or imitation." Being presented with this task can be difficult as there are already so many original things out there, it is very tough to think of something of your own to add to that pile. Tackling this challenge alone can be an issue, but when you work together, anything can be possible, even when it looks like it would all go wrong. 

Facing this obstacle together, my group and I created a feudal Japanese inspired puzzle platformer based on the deaths of Samurai, abtly named Seppuku.

This group consisted of the following members...

Kristijan Zvonarek (Producer and Programmer)

Yuri Jia (Programmer)

Adeline Zhang (Artist)

Davis Germain (Sound Designer)
