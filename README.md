# Seppuku - Exploring The Unknown

Originality at its core means one thing, that is "created directly and personally by a particular artist; not a copy or imitation." Being presented with this task can be difficult as there are already so many original things out there, it is very tough to think of something of your own to add to that pile. Tackling this challenge alone can be an issue, but when you work together, anything can be possible, even when it looks like it would all go wrong. 

Facing this obstacle together, my group and I created a feudal Japanese inspired puzzle platformer based on the deaths of Samurai, abtly named Seppuku.

This group consisted of the following members...

Kristijan Zvonarek (Producer and Programmer)

Yuri Jia (Programmer)

Adeline Zhang (Artist)

Davis Germain (Sound Designer)

# The Pitch

It was not decided at the start that Seppuku would be created. My group and I were given the task to come up with three game ideas, all for different platforms including mobile devices, a "Jam-O-Drum", and "The Cave". Whether one of these ideas would be chosen was completely up to the TAs and Professors. To my understanding a game was chosen based on creativity, possible functionality, and how it compared to other groups as there was a limit to how many could work with either one of the platforms.
